Background/Introduction/Client Information
  In recent years, there has been a surge in the interest in personal health and food quality. Accompaning these new interest there has been a dramatic increase in local and urban farms. The problem arises when the smaller farms try to compete with the production and prices of larger specialized farms. Our goal for a project is to help smaller scale, local farmers increase efficiency without dramatically increasing cost. Our client is Jacob Spring's Farm but we will also be attempting to aid the population smaller-scaled farmer. In order to accomplish this goal, our team is specifically addressing ventilation systems in greenhouses. Greenhouses must be kept at certain conditions year around in order to optimize production. There are currently products on the market that automate ventilation, but these products are too expensive for smaller scale farmers to afford. 

Design Requirements

Our temperature sensor must be able to determine when the temperature inside hits below 50 degrees fahrenheit, and above 68 degrees fahrenheit. These lower and upper limits are common ranges for most plants grown inside a greenhouse and making our device to keep the temperature within this range would allow for the plants to grow in an ideal environment during the whole year.
